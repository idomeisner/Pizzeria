# Pizza Restaurant

## Run
To run the python project, run the file `run_pizzeria.py`:  
`python src/run_pizzeria.py`

## Flags
- `-g` - Create a file with random pizza orders. `pizza_orders.json` will be created.  
`python src/run_pizzeria.py -g`
- `-dr` - Don't Run the pizza restaurant.  
Will probably come together `-g` - create a new pizza orders file without running the entire project.  
`python src/run_pizzeria.py -g -dr`

## Notes
- You can edit the configurations (number of pizzeria workers and their work duration) in `config.yml`.

- After the run has finished, you can view the output report in the file `report.json`.
